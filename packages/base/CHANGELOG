0.18.0.0
--------

    * Many new functions and instances in the Static module

    * meanCov and gaussianSample use Herm type

    * thinQR, thinRQ

    * compactSVDTol

    * unitary changed to normalize, also admits Vector (Complex Double)

0.17.0.0
--------

    * eigSH, chol, and other functions that work with Hermitian or symmetric matrices
      now take a special "Herm" argument that can be created by means of "sym"
      or "mTm". The unchecked versions of those functions have been removed and we
      use "trustSym" to create the Herm type when the matrix is known to be Hermitian/symmetric.

    * Improved matrix extraction (??) and rectangular matrix slices without data copy

    * Basic support of Int32 and Int64 elements

    * remap, more general cond, sortIndex

    * Experimental support of type safe modular arithmetic, including linear
      system solver and LU factorization

    * Elementary row operations and inplace matrix slice products in the ST monad

    * Improved development tools.

    * Old compatibility modules removed, simpler organization of internal modules

    * unitary, pairwiseD2, tr'

    * ldlPacked, ldlSolve for indefinite symmetric systems (apparently not faster
      than the general solver based on the LU)

    * LU, LDL, and QR types for these compact decompositions.

0.16.1.0
--------

    * Added (|||) and (===) for "besides" and "above"

    * rowOuters

0.16.0.0
--------

    * The modules Numeric.GSL.* have been moved to the new package hmatrix-gsl.

    * The package "hmatrix" now depends only on BLAS and LAPACK and the
      license has been changed to BSD3.

    * Added more organized reexport modules:
        Numeric.LinearAlgebra.HMatrix
        Numeric.LinearAlgebra.Data
        Numeric.LinearAlgebra.Devel

      For normal usage we only need to import Numeric.LinearAlgebra.HMatrix.

      (The documentation is now hidden for Data.Packed.*, Numeric.Container, and
      the other Numeric.LinearAlgebra.* modules, but they continue to be exposed
      for backwards compatibility.)

    * Added support for empty arrays, extending automatic conformability
      (very useful for construction of block matrices).

    * Added experimental support for sparse linear systems.

    * Added experimental support for static dimension checking and inference
      using type-level literals.

    * Added a different operator for the matrix-vector product.
      (available from the new reexport module).

    * "join" deprecated (use "vjoin").

    * "dot" now conjugates the first input vector.

    * Added "udot" (unconjugated dot product).

    * Added to/from ByteString

    * Added "sortVector", "roundVector"

    * Added Monoid instance for Matrix using matrix product.

    * Added several pretty print functions

    * Improved "build", "konst", "linspace", "LSDiv", loadMatrix', and other small changes.

    * In hmatrix-glpk: (:=>:) change to (:>=:). Added L_1 linear system solvers.

    * Improved error messages.

    * Added many usage examples in the documentation.
